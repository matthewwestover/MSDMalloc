This was an assignment for my CS6013 - Operating Systems Course

The goal of this assignment was to create a "drop in" alternative to the system ```malloc();```

### Running

Download Files: ```catch.hpp, CMakeLists.txt, MSDHashTable.cpp, MSDHashTable.hpp, MSDMalloc.cpp, MSDMalloc.hpp, testing.cpp```

In same folder as files run `cmake .` to create useable Makefile. 
Run `make`
Run `./testing` for testing suite to run. This includes benchmark times.
